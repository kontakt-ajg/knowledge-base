handing over a volume collection from one a Nimble whos default iscsi target scope is volume to a different Nimble whos default iscsi target scope is group results in the handedover volume to keep its iscsi target scope of volume.
it seems only newly created volumes are affected by the default iscsi target scope value. a volumes iscsi target scope can be changed through the cli.
